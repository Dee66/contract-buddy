# ü§ñ Model & AI Strategy

> **Purpose:**
> Select and justify the AI approach for CodeCraft AI, ensuring up-to-date, context-aware, and high-quality code generation.

---

## üîç Model Candidate Research

- **Large Language Models (LLMs):**
  - Evaluate open-source (e.g., Code Llama, StarCoder, WizardCoder) and commercial (e.g., GPT-4, Gemini) models for code generation.
  - Assess models for language coverage, code quality, extensibility, and licensing.

- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):**
  - Use embeddings to retrieve relevant code snippets, documentation, and best practices from curated sources (e.g., Stack Overflow, official docs, internal codebases).
  - RAG ensures suggestions are current and tailored to the user‚Äôs tech stack.

## ‚öñÔ∏è AI Strategy Decision

- **Chosen Approach:**
  - **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) + LLM Synthesis**
    - RAG provides up-to-date, context-rich information.
    - LLM synthesizes code using retrieved context, user prompt, and architectural hints.
    - This hybrid approach balances accuracy, freshness, and flexibility.

- **Rationale:**
  - RAG mitigates LLM hallucination and outdated knowledge.
  - Enables rapid adaptation to new frameworks, libraries, and coding standards.
  - Supports explainability by surfacing sources for generated code.

---

## üßÆ Model Evaluation Criteria

- **Accuracy:** Code correctness and adherence to best practices.
- **Latency:** Time to generate a response.
- **Explainability:** Ability to trace code suggestions to sources.
- **Cost:** Inference and hosting costs per 1K tokens.
- **Extensibility:** Support for new languages/frameworks.

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Fallback & Continuous Improvement

- **Fallback Strategy:**
  If retrieval fails, gracefully degrade to LLM-only generation with a warning to the user.
- **Continuous Improvement:**
  Collect user feedback on code quality and relevance; use this data to retrain or fine-tune models and update retrieval sources.

> **Professional Insight:**
> RAG is the gold standard for production AI assistantscombining the creativity of LLMs with the reliability of curated, real-world knowledge.
