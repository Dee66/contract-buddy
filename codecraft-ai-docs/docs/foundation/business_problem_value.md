## üí° Value Proposition & ROI

- **Business Value:**
  CodeCraft AI accelerates software delivery by generating production-ready code, reducing manual effort, and minimizing errors.
- **Cost Savings:**
  - Reduces developer time spent on boilerplate and research by up to 50%.
  - Lowers onboarding costs for new team members by providing instant, context-aware code examples.
- **Strategic Leverage:**
  - Enables rapid prototyping and faster go-to-market for new features.
  - Improves code quality and consistency across teams.
  - Lays the foundation for monetization via SaaS/API offerings.
- **Competitive Landscape:**

  - Unlike Copilot or Tabnine, CodeCraft AI is designed for extensibility, explainability, and enterprise integration, with a focus on compliance and custom workflows.

- **ROI Example:**
  If a team of 5 developers saves 2 hours/week each, at $60/hour, that‚Äôs $600/month or $7,200/year in productivity gainsbefore considering quality and velocity improvements.

| Team Size | Hours Saved/Week | Hourly Rate | Monthly Savings | Annual Savings |
| --------- | ---------------- | ----------- | --------------- | -------------- |
| 5         | 10               | $60         | $600            | $7,200         |
| 10        | 20               | $60         | $1,200          | $14,400        |
